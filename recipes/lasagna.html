    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is a vibrant and easy dish using a quick-cooking cut of lamb. The dressing is bursting with flavour and, along with the salty olives, is a perfect foil for the meat.</p>
    <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds, toasted</li>
        <li>finely grated zest 1 lemon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons capers</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon each finely chopped mint and parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Brush the lamb with a little oil and season with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Heat a large frying pan and when very hot, cook the lamb for about 2-3 minutes each side for medium-rare. Cooking time will depend on the thickness of the lamb. Try and get a good crust on the lamb. Transfer to a plate and rest, lightly covered, for
            5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Dressing: Stir all the ingredients together in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>To serve: Slice the lamb against the grain and place on a platter. Drizzle with the meat resting juices, then scatter over the olives and spoon over the dressing.</li>
