    <img src="dish.jpg" alt="A delicious dish">
    <h3>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is a vibrant and easy dish using a quick-cooking cut of lamb. The dressing is bursting with flavour and, along with the salty olives, is a perfect foil for the meat.</p>

        <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds, toasted</li>
        <li>finely grated zest 1 lemon</li>

    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Brush the lamb with a little oil and season with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Heat a large frying pan and when very hot, cook the lamb for about 2-3 minutes each side for medium-rare. Cooking time will depend on the thickness of the lamb. Try and get a good crust on the lamb. Transfer to a plate and rest, lightly covered, for
            5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Dressing: Stir all the ingredients together in a bowl and season with salt and pepper. </li>

            From Robert Stadniczenko’s Arapai vineyard on the Dry River Flats, comes the Stad_ko Martinborough Pinot Noir 2020 ($39) This dry, spicy, leather layered and earthy pinot noir is edged with allspice and baked tamarillo, and it’s beyond lovely with lamb. Stadko.com</li>
