    <h2>Two Bean and Crisp Flatbread Salad with Soft Eggs</h2>
    <img src="dish3.jpg" alt="A delicious dish">
    <h3>Description:</h2>
    <p>Shards of crisp bread, creamy white beans and a perky preserved lemon dressing make a light but substantial salad.</p>
    <h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
       <li>2 x 20cm Lebanese flatbreads</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
       <li>250 grams slim green beans, stem end trimmed</li>
       <li>sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180Â°C fan bake.</li>
        <li>Brush both sides of the bread with butter and place on a flat baking tray. Bake for about 10 minutes, turning once, until golden and crisp.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan and when hot, add the beans. Cook for about 4 minutes, turning often, until lightly blistered in patches. Season with salt and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Dressing: Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>To serve: Break the crisp flatbreads into large pieces. Layer up the watercress, green and white beans, cucumber, onion, eggs and basil on a large platter, tucking in some of the bread. Drizzle over the dressing. Serve the remaining bread separately.</li>
